# Bakery

A mod for [Balatro](https://www.playbalatro.com/) that adds various miscellaneous things, created by BakersDozenBagels.

Additions are generally meant to be well-balanced with vanilla, although the decks are a bit wackier.

Current contents:

- 22 Jokers
- 10 Charms (a new kind of thing in the shop)
- 20 Tags
- 3 Decks
- 3 [Deck Sleeves](https://github.com/larswijn/CardSleeves)
- 5 Blinds
- 3 Challenges
- 1 Tarot Card
- 2 Spectral Cards
- 2 Enhancements
- 1 Edition
- Miscellaneous modding API features (If this mod does something interesting, it can probably be used as a dependency to do that thing)

## Cross-Mod Content

With certain other mods installed, Bakery will add extra items:
- [Revo's Vault](https://github.com/Cdrvo/Revos-Vault---Balatro-Mod) - 1 Charm
- [MoreFluff](https://github.com/notmario/MoreFluff) - 1 Charm
- [Cryptid](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid) - 2 Charms

## Installation

1. Bakery requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods). Follow the instructions to install it if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository into your mods folder, or download it as a zip and place it there.
3. Enjoy!

## Lite Version

If another mod depends on Bakery, but you do not want Bakery's additions, you can install the [lite version](https://github.com/BakersDozenBagels/BalatroBakery/tree/lite). This version only has a modding API and nothing else. Note that both versions can be installed together without issue so long as both are up-to-date.
